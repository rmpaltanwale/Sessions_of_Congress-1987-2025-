# Sessions_of_Congress-1987-2025
## Introduction

For my Spring 2025 semester course, Web Design and Implementation (ICS 225), the final project required
creating a 20-page HTML website with the help of CSS for styling and layout, with the choice of the topic being up to us. 
I developed a 20-page HTML website titled "The History of the U.S. Congress (1987-Present)", which explores key legislative 
sessions, political shifts, and major events in recent congressional history. The project demonstrates my ability to
design, structure, and style a multi-page website using fundamental web development technologies.

## Relevance and Skill Development

This project strengthened my understanding of how to present complex historical and institutional
information in a clear, accessible, and structured format. Through research, organization, and careful design,
I gained experience in transforming factual data into an engaging digital resource. It also helped refine my
attention to detail, analytical thinking, and ability to communicate information accurately - skills that are
essential in roles requiring precision, documentation, and public engagement.

## Project parameters

According to the rules of this project, we had to create a website with 20 pages, written using HTML and CSS. We also had to 
include the screenshots of at least 8 of those 20 pages. Each page needed to demonstrate
consistent layout design, proper navigation links, semantic HTML structure, and visual styling through CSS.
Additionally, the project was required to feature clear organization, external and internal links, multimedia
integration (such as images or embedded content), and a well-formatted reference page. The overall goal
was to apply the principles of web accessibility, usability, and coherent visual design in a cohesive website
experience.

## Website structure

The website is organized into 20 interconnected HTML pages, each focusing on a specific period, topic, or theme related to 
the history of the U.S. Congress from 1987 to the present. The structure was designed to ensure intuitive navigation and 
logical progression through the content.

-- Homepage: Introduces the topic, purpose, and historical scope of the website.

- Timeline Pages: Present key legislative sessions and major political developments across multiple decades.

- Leadership and Committees Pages: Highlight important congressional leaders, committee changes, and policy focuses.

- Legislation Pages: Summarize significant bills, reforms, and acts passed during the covered period.

- Media and Public Opinion Page: Explores how media coverage and public sentiment have evolved with Congress.

- References Page: Lists credible academic, government, and media sources used in research.

Each page is linked through a consistent navigation bar and footer section, maintaining uniformity and accessibility 
throughout the site. The layout employs reusable CSS components for typography, color scheme, and spacing to ensure a 
cohesive user experience.
