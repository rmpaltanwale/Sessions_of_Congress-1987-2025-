# Sessions_of_Congress-1987-2025
## Introduction

For my Spring 2025 semester course, Web Design and Implementation (ICS 225), the final project required
creating a 20-page HTML website with the help of CSS for styling and layout. I developed a 20-page HTML
website titled "The History of the U.S. Congress (1987-Present)", which explores key legislative sessions,
political shifts, and major events in recent congressional history. The project demonstrates my ability to
design, structure, and style a multi-page website using fundamental web development technologies.

## Relevance and Skill Development

This project strengthened my understanding of how to present complex historical and institutional
information in a clear, accessible, and structured format. Through research, organization, and careful design,
I gained experience in transforming factual data into an engaging digital resource. It also helped refine my
attention to detail, analytical thinking, and ability to communicate information accurately - skills that are
essential in roles requiring precision, documentation, and public engagement.
